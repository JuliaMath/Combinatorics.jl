A combinatorics library for Julia, focusing mostly (as of now) on enumerative
combinatorics and permutations.  As overflows are expected even for low values,
most of the functions always return `BigInt`, and are marked as such below.

## Installation

In the Julia REPL, type `]add Combinatorics` and then `using Combinatorics` to access the below functions.

## Documentation

Go to http://juliamath.github.io/Combinatorics.jl/ to see the list of exported functions and their meanings.
