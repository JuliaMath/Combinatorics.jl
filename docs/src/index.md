# Getting started

A combinatorics library for Julia, focusing mostly (as of now) on enumerative combinatorics and permutations. As overflows are expected even for low values, most of the functions always return BigInt, and are marked as such below.

## Installation

In the Julia REPL, type `]add Combinatorics` and then `using Combinatorics` to access the functions listed below.
